# SchoolLaunch — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview

SchoolLaunch is a Washington State charter school financial planning SaaS. Founders model their school's finances across staffing, revenue, operations, and multi-year projections, then receive AI-powered advisory analysis against the WA Charter School Commission's Financial Performance Framework (FPF).

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `organizations` | Organization-level grouping |
| `schools` | School records (name, org_id, status) |
| `school_profiles` | Demographics, enrollment, financial_assumptions (JSONB), advisory_cache (JSONB), logo_url |
| `user_roles` | Multi-user access: user_id + school_id + role (school_ceo, school_editor, school_viewer, org_admin, super_admin) + display_name, tour_completed |
| `staffing_positions` | 27 Commission-aligned position types with salary, FTE, year, classification, driver |
| `budget_projections` | Revenue and expense line items per school per year |
| `grade_expansion_plan` | Grade-by-grade expansion with sections, students_per_section, retention |
| `invitations` | Email invitations with token, role, school_id, expiration |
| `alignment_reviews` | AI-generated alignment review results |
| `org_notes` | Organization-level notes |

### Scenarios Table (Sandboxed)

The `scenarios` table is an **isolated sandbox** — changes here never modify budget_projections, staffing_positions, school_profiles, or any other table.

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| `school_id` | uuid | — | FK to schools (NOT NULL) |
| `name` | text | — | 'Conservative', 'Base Case', or 'Optimistic' (NOT NULL) |
| `is_base_case` | boolean | false | Legacy flag for old scenario slider |
| `assumptions` | jsonb | '{}' | 5 lever values (enrollment_fill_rate, per_pupil_funding_adjustment, personnel_cost_adjustment, facility_cost_monthly, startup_capital) |
| `results` | jsonb | null | Computed 5-year projections with FPF compliance per year |
| `ai_analysis` | text | null | Cached AI scenario comparison narrative |
| `scenario_type` | text | 'base_case' | 'base_case' (legacy) or 'engine' (new scenario engine) |
| `base_data_hash` | text | null | Hash of school's base data for staleness detection |
| `is_active` | boolean | true | Soft delete flag |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | now() | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | now() | Last modification timestamp |

### Storage

- **Bucket**: `school-logos` (public read, CEO-only write via RLS)
- **Path pattern**: `{school_id}/logo.{ext}`

### RLS Policies

All tables have RLS enabled. Data tables use split policies:
- **SELECT**: All school-linked roles (ceo, editor, viewer) + org_admin via organization join
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: school_ceo and school_editor only
- **Viewers** are read-only at the database level
- **user_roles**: "users see own role" + "ceo sees school team" (uses SECURITY DEFINER function to avoid circular RLS)

## Dashboard Structure

Left sidebar with 12 tabs in 4 groups:

**Planning**: Overview, Revenue, Staffing, Operations
**Projections**: Cash Flow, Multi-Year, **Scenarios**
**Assessment**: Ask SchoolLaunch, Advisory Panel, Alignment Review, Commission Scorecard
**Settings**: Settings

## Key Architecture

### Financial Calculation Engine

- `src/lib/calculations.ts` — Revenue model: `calcCommissionRevenue()` with 14 line items (Regular Ed, SPED, State SPED, Facilities, Levy Equity, Title I, IDEA, LAP, LAP High Poverty, TBIP, HiCap, Food Service Rev, Transportation Rev, Interest)
- `src/lib/budgetEngine.ts` — Multi-year projections: `computeMultiYearDetailed()`, `computeFPFScorecard()`, `computeCarryForward()`, `computeSummaryFromProjections()`
- `src/lib/types.ts` — `FinancialAssumptions`, `SchoolProfile`, `DEFAULT_ASSUMPTIONS`, 27 `COMMISSION_POSITIONS`

### Financial Constants

- WA charter fiscal year: September 1 – August 31
- Benefits load: 30% (SEBB + FICA)
- Salary escalator: 2.5% annually
- Revenue COLA: 3% annually
- Operations escalator: 2% annually
- Authorizer fee: 3% of state apportionment (non-negotiable)
- OSPI payment schedule: Sep 9%, Oct 8%, Nov 5%, Dec 9%, Jan 8.5%, Feb 9%, Mar 9%, Apr 9%, May 5%, Jun 6%, Jul 12.5%, Aug 10%

### Scenario Engine

Sandboxed modeling environment at `/dashboard/scenarios`. Pulls base case data as starting point but all changes are isolated to the `scenarios` table.

**5 Financial Levers:**
| Lever | Range | Type |
|-------|-------|------|
| Enrollment Fill Rate | 70%–100% | Slider (percentage) |
| Per-Pupil Funding Adjustment | -10% to +5% | Slider (percentage) |
| Personnel Cost Adjustment | -10% to +15% | Slider (percentage) |
| Monthly Facility Cost | $0–$50,000 | Number input (currency) |
| Startup Capital | $0–$1,000,000 | Number input (currency) |

**3 Named Scenarios** per school: Conservative, Base Case, Optimistic — with smart defaults derived from the school's actual financial data.

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/scenarioEngine.ts` — Applies lever adjustments to base case data, then runs through `computeMultiYearDetailed` + `computeFPFScorecard`
- `src/app/api/scenarios/seed/route.ts` — POST: creates 3 scenarios with defaults
- `src/app/api/scenarios/calculate/route.ts` — POST: computes 5-year projections for one or all scenarios
- `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/scenarios/page.tsx` — Full scenario UI with lever controls, 3-column comparison, FPF compliance, AI analysis

**Integrations:**
- Overview page: Scenario Summary card with Reserve Days + FPF badges per scenario
- Budget Narrative PDF: Scenario Analysis section with comparison table + AI narrative
- Commission Excel export: SCENARIOS tab with assumptions, projections, and FPF matrix

### Advisory System

7 AI agents (Commission Reviewer, Enrollment Realist, Staffing Advisor, Compliance Officer, Operations Analyst, Board Finance Chair, SchoolCFO Advisor) + synthesized briefing.

**Key architecture decisions:**
- `buildAgentContextString()` — Summarized context for agents with pre-computed metrics as prose (no raw data that enables recomputation)
- `buildSchoolContextString()` — Full context for briefing synthesis and Ask SchoolLaunch chat
- Advisory cache: `school_profiles.advisory_cache` (JSONB) — both Overview and Advisory Panel query Supabase directly on mount to get latest cache
- Cache invalidation: `computeAdvisoryHash()` computes stable hash from rounded financial metrics
- Agents receive pre-computed Days of Cash value — never compute independently

### Multi-User Collaboration

- Roles: school_ceo (Owner), school_editor (Editor), school_viewer (Viewer), org_admin, super_admin
- `usePermissions()` hook provides: canEdit, canManageTeam, canResetSchool, canEditIdentity, canExport, canUseAI
- Viewers get read-only access across all tabs (disabled inputs, hidden Save/Add/Delete buttons)
- Team management: `/api/team/invite`, `/api/team`, `/api/team/[userId]`
- School switcher for multi-school users via sessionStorage (`sl_selected_school`)
- Invitation acceptance supports both new users (create account) and existing users (sign in & join)

## Development Notes

- **Do not push** — Travis handles all git pushes manually
- **Supabase MCP** — Use for all schema inspections and migrations (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`)
- **Advisory caching** — Both Overview and Advisory pages query Supabase directly for `advisory_cache` on mount (not from React state) to avoid stale-cache bugs
- **useSchoolData** — Supports multi-school users via sessionStorage school selection
- **All `.single()` calls on user_roles replaced** with multi-row queries to support users with roles at multiple schools
